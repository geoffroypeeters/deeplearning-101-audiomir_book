# Running codebooks in Google Colab

We describe here how you can run in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) the notebooks we provide for this tutorial and therefore reproduce the  experiments we present.

*Google Colab, short for Collaboratory, is a free, cloud-based platform by Google that allows users to write and execute Python code in a Jupyter Notebook environment. Itâ€™s especially popular for machine learning and data science tasks because it provides access to powerful hardware like GPUs and TPUs at no cost.*

From Colab, choose `Import`, `Github`, and indicate the following repository `https://github.com/geoffroypeeters/deeplearning-101-audiomir_notebook.git`.

Within the imported notebook, change `do_deploy` to` True`.
If you then run the notebook, it will automatically
- import/install all necessary packages,
- git clone the code of this tutorial in your local (temporary) Colab space
- download/unzip the necessary datasets (audio in .hdf5 and annotations in .pyjama) in your local (temporary) Colab space

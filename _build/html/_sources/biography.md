[ Geoffroy Peeters](https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/gpeeters/) is a full professor in the Image-Data-Signal (IDS) department of [Télécom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/). Before that (from 2001 to 2018), he was Senior Researcher at IRCAM, leading research related to Music Information Retrieval. He received his Ph.D. in signal processing for speech processing in 2001 and his Habilitation (HDR) in Music Information Retrieval in 2013 from the University Paris VI. His research topics concern signal processing and machine learning (including deep learning) for audio processing, with a strong focus on music. He has participated in many national or European projects, published numerous articles and several patents in these areas, and co-authored the ISO MPEG-7 audio standard. He has been co-general-chair of the DAFx-2011 and ISMIR-2018 conferences, member and president of the ISMIR society, and is the current AASP review chair for ICASSP.

[Alain Riou](https://github.com/aRI0U) is a PhD student working on self-supervised learning of musical representations at Télécom-Paris and Sony CSL Paris, under the supervision of Stefan Lattner, Gaëtan Hadjeres and Geoffroy Peeters.
Before that, he obtained a master degree in mathematics for machine learning at Ecole Normale Supérieure de Cachan (2020) and another one in signal processing and computer science applied to music at IRCAM (2021).
His main research interests are related to deep representation learning, with a strong focus on self-supervised methods for music information retrieval and controllable music generation.
His work "PESTO: Pitch Estimation with Self-supervised Transposition-equivariant Objective" received the Best Paper Award at ISMIR 2023.

[Stefan Lattner](https://csl.sony.fr/member/stefan-lattner-phd/) serves as a researcher leader at the music team at [Sony CSL](https://csl.sony.fr) Paris, where he focuses on generative AI for music production, music information retrieval, and computational music perception. He earned his PhD in 2019 from Johannes Kepler University (JKU) in Linz, Austria, following his research at the Austrian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Vienna and the Institute of Computational Perception Linz. His studies centered on the modeling of musical structure, encompassing transformation learning and computational relative pitch perception.
His current interests include human-computer interaction in music creation, live staging, and information theory in music.
He specializes in generative sequence models, computational short-term memories, (self-supervised) representation learning and musical audio generation. In 2019, Lattner received the best paper award at ISMIR for his work, “Learning Complex Basis Functions for Invariant Representations of Audio.”

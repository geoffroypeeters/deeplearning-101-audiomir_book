# Music Audio Analysis

Music Audio Analysis refers to the subset of MIR research which targets the <mark>extraction of information</mark> from the <mark>music content</mark> using <mark>audio analysis</mark>.

Such information can relate to
- <mark>musical notation</mark> (onset, **pitches**, **chords**, key, beats/downbeats, tempo, meter, instrumentation, lyrics)
